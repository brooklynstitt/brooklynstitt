- Hi, I’m @brooklynstitt!!
- I am a proud computer science student at California State University Bakersfield!
- I am currently learning C++ from CSUB as well as Python and C# on my free time!
- I also have been working as a Starbucks barista for about 10 months now and love the people I work with!
- While I am still learning and am new, I am dedicated and excited for what computer science has in store for me!
